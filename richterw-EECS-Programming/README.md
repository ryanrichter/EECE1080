EECS-Programming created for ryanrichter

This class was an introduction to more complicated C++ concepts taken in the second semester of freshman year. Here is a guide to the class by lab

Lab 2: Basic operations and operators.
Lab 3: Function creation and implementation.
Lab 4: Complicated functions based on theoretical equations (Newton-Raphson, circuits, etc).
Lab 5: A bigger project based on a dice-wager game.
Lab 6: Part 1: Complicated vector implementation.
Lab 6: Part 2: A text-based board game utilizing a character board and board positions.

finalproj: The largest project of the class. A Battleship implementation in C++. Kind of similar to Lab 6 Part 2.
